<hr>

[CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) is a container-centric Linux distribution
designed for clustered systems running in the cloud. The host system itself
provides the minimal functionality, with user applications running inside
containers.

This guide details installing CoreOS on your KVM Linode. If you're currently
running a Xen Linode, you can
[upgrade](/docs/platform/kvm#how-to-enable-kvm), but it is currently not
possible to install CoreOS on a Xen Linode.

This method of installing CoreOS creates a partition table on the disk image,
which is incompatible with the Backups service. See [Caveats](#caveats) for
more details.

## Before you begin

{: .note}
> These instructions perform **destructive** operations on your Linode. You
> should not attempt to install CoreOS on a Linode with data you'd like to
> keep. You may wish to [use a second Linode and transfer your data after
> installation](/docs/security/recovering-from-a-system-compromise#using-a-second-linode).

You should prepare a [CoreOS-style cloud-config
file](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html) with authentication
details. This is because CoreOS by default configures no way to log in except
by supplying an option to the kernel command line.

At minimum, you should have an `authorized_keys` file available.

## Prepare the Linode

1. From the [Linode Manager](https://manager.linode.com/), create a new Linode.

2. Under the *Disks* section of the Linode Dashboard, click on **Create a new
   Disk**:

    [![Create a new disk](/docs/assets/custom-distro-new-disk_small.png)](/docs/assets/custom-distro-new-disk.png)

3. Label your new disk image and choose an appropriate size. You will probably
   need to allocate at least **5 GB**. Set the *Type* to **unformatted / raw**.
  
    [![Specify disk name and size](/docs/assets/coreos-disk-image.png)](/docs/assets/coreos-disk-image.png)

   If you're not sure how big your disk image needs to be, you may wish to
   choose a small size so that you can grow the disk later. You will not be
   able to shrink the disk image.

4. Return to the *Linode Dashboard*, and select the **Rescue** tab. Check to
   make sure the disk image you created is set as `/dev/sda`, then click the
   **Reboot into Rescue Mode** button. Your Linode will now boot into the
   Finnix recovery image. Use the
   [Lish](/docs/networking/using-the-linode-shell-lish) shell to access your
   Linode.

## Collect the installation files

{: .note}
> These commands should be run from a root prompt under Finnix through Lish.

CoreOS can be installed using a self-contained
[script](https://github.com/coreos/init/blob/master/bin/coreos-install) which
automates the task of downloading an appropriate release image and copying it
to disk.

1. In order to securely download this script, it's recommended to install the
   appropriate CA certificates from the Debian repositories.

        apt-get update
        apt-get install ca-certificates

2. Now download the script from GitHub and mark it executable:

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/init/master/bin/coreos-install
        chmod +x coreos-install

3. You may wish to read the options available to install CoreOS:

        ./coreos-install -h

Now you will want to copy your cloud-config file to your Linode. It's probably
most easy to simply `cat > cloud-config.yml` and paste into your Lish shell.
However, if you prefer, you can run the following command to start the SSH
server to securely copy your cloud-config file. (Note that you will need to set
up access credentials, e.g. SSH keys or a password, separately.)

        service ssh start

## Install CoreOS to disk

1. Run `coreos-install` on your disk image:

        ./coreos-install -v -d /dev/sda -c path/to/cloud-config.yml

   You can also supply any other options (see `coreos-install -h`). If you do
   not want verbose output, you can leave out the `-v` flag.

2. ADVANCED: at this point, you can modify the image by mounting `/dev/sda9`.
   For example, if you have not provided a cloud-config file, you can add an
   `authorized_keys` for the `core` user as follows:

        mount /dev/sda9
        cat > /media/sda9/home/core/.ssh/authorized_keys <<EOF 
        # ... ssh keys ...
        EOF

3. Power off your Linode.

        shutdown -h now

## Configure your Linode to boot CoreOS

1. Return to the *Linode Dashboard*, and under *Dashboard* select **Create a
   new Configuration Profile**.

2. Under *Boot Settings*, click on the *Kernel* drop-down menu and select
   **Direct Disk**. Since CoreOS is installed with its own partition table and
   MBR, we cannot use the Linode-provided kernels.

3. Under *Block Device Assignment*, set */dev/sda* to the CoreOS disk image you
   created and installed CoreOS to.

    [![Configuration profile](/docs/assets/coreos-config-profile.png)](/docs/assets/coreos-config-profile.png)

4. All other settings can be left in their default state.

5. Return to the *Linode Dashboard*, select the new configuration profile, and
   click **Reboot**

## Logging in to your Linode running CoreOS

1. With Lish open, you should see your Linode booting into CoreOS, finishing
   with a list of SSH host keys and a login prompt, something similar to:

        This is li1010-4 (Linux x86_64 4.1.7-coreos-r1) 22:19:29
        SSH host key: 36:b5:e9:cd:8b:74:e9:52:fd:54:b1:30:78:af:f2:11 (DSA)
        SSH host key: 13:fe:66:49:35:35:5e:64:ae:4f:64:65:e2:98:8a:d4 (ED25519)
        SSH host key: 60:97:2c:b3:bf:2b:42:71:11:42:93:ff:ba:9f:ca:07 (RSA)
        eth0: 45.33.64.4 2600:3c03::f03c:91ff:fea8:7abf

        li1010-4 login: 

2. You should now be able to access your Linode via SSH. You should confirm
   that the host keys match the first time you log in, to reduce your risk from
   MITM attack.

## Caveats

When using this method, the CoreOS installer creates a partition table on the
disk image, which will interfere with the Backups service, as the disk image
will not be directly mountable. Unlike the case with most partitioned images,
you *will* be able to resize the disk image holding a CoreOS system; however,
it can only grow, not shrink. CoreOS will resize its root partition to fill the
disk on next boot.
